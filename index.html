			<h3>Introdcution to Chicago</h3>

			<p>Chicago is the third largest city in the United States and is home to around 2.7 million people. With a population of this size, crime is to be expected, and in the case of Chicago, some view it as out of control. The recent headlines and quotes from President Donald Trump state how Chicago needs to be cleaned up. While local politicians claim that the city has only gotten safer. The data provided by the Chicago Police Department, along with my own findings, helped to show both how the city handles crime today and its trends over the last few years. </p>

			<p> While conducting research for this story, I reached out to former police officer John Dorner. John was a police officer in Park Ridge for 27 years, serving as both a patrol officer and as a homicide investigator. John was responsible for answering calls and reports of not only robberies but also violence, homicide, suspicious activity, and more. Dealing with crime statistics firsthand that are discussed freely in political dialogue.</p>

			<p>When asked regarding how Chicago crime is discussed and reported on, Dorner responded with</p>
			<p> "Regarding accuracy, it's a mix of yes and no. Chicago is not an unsafe area per se, but politicians paint a picture of what is best for them.”</p>
			<p>Stating how as a citizen, be cognizant, and have situational awareness about where you are and when you are out. </p> 

			<p>Below is a graph of all robberies that have taken place in 2025 through September. And these locations have a strong presence in areas in the Loop, Near North, West Side, and more. These are also some of the most densely populated areas of the city. In these areas, being more alert and aware can help you avoid putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation. </p>

			<h3>Homicides and Perception</h3>
			<p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has been vocal about his stance on crime. He rejected the proposed National Guard deployment, claiming it is unnecessary for American troops to be deployed into American cities.</p>
			<p>"The fact of the matter is we are driving violence down in this city, and we're using every single resource that's available to us," Johnson said.</p>
			<p>Illinois state representative Patrick Sheehan responded to these claims by saying</p>
			 <p>"Mayor Johnson’s comments are reckless, insulting, and dangerous. To stand before the people of Chicago and declare that law enforcement is a ‘sickness’ is an affront to every police officer who has sworn an oath to protect and serve, and to every family that has lost a loved one to violent crime. Law enforcement is not a disease. It is the very foundation of public safety, the shield that protects communities from chaos, and the thin line that separates order from anarchy."</p>
			<p>This division amongst Illinois politicians has added to the discourse regarding the current state of the city. With the mayor and state representative on opposing sides, it leaves the residents of Illinois and across the country left choosing sides. Which leads to discourse regarding crime so polarizing. Some say not enough is being done and others are opposed to a potential overcorrection of bringing in the National Guard.</p>
			<p>There may be no perfect solution to significantly reduce crime. Nobody is advocating for more crime, but the state of Chicago’s crime has seemed inflated to some and under-reported to others. The difference in perception between Johnson and Sheehan boils down to which crime statistics you choose to focus on.</p>
			<p>Looking at the most extreme end of criminal offense, homicides have seen steady decline. Homicides are one of the most discussed crimes all across America. Homicide rates in Chicago have experienced declines through the first 9 months over the past two years, with a 130-case decrease in homicides from 2024-2025 in that span.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Chicago is a city unlike any other throughout the country. The history, culture, location, and landmarks make it firmly one of America’s major cities. No matter what side of the argument you land on, the safety of others is the most important. </p>
			<p>These dots on a chart and elements of a graph are the resemblance of real people. Real stories of robberies and homicides that have taken place in Chicago. It is important not to lose sight of this fact. </p>
			<p>To answer the question of “How safe is Chicago?” is different for every person. We know ways to help keep ourselves safe and avoid potentially dangerous situations. We also know that a major city like Chicago has its benefits and potential drawbacks in terms of safety.</p>
			<p>Whether it is politicians fighting to bring down crime through legislation, or policemen like John Dorner who directly work to fight against crime, everyone wants the city to be as safe as possible. It is up to the collective residents and country to stay informed and make decisions to help the city become a safer place.</p>
